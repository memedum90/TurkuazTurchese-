absolutely
exactly
indeed
you're right
that's for sure
agree completely
correct 
i agree
i couldn't agree with you more
that's so true
that's true
for sure
that's sure
that's for sure
tell me about it
you're right
you're absolutely right
absolutely
that's exactly how i feel
exactly
i have to side with
i side with
no doubt about it
me neither
i suppose so
i guess so
i think so
you have a point there
i was just going to say that
of course
you're absolutely right
yes i agree
i think so too
that's a good point
exactly
i don't think so either
so do i
that's it
you got it
you're right
I'd go along with that
that's true
neither do i
i agree with you entirely
that's just what i was thinking
i couldn't agree more
////
doesn't that seem
isn't it
that's not true
i don't agree
i don't accept that
can't agree
you're wrong
it's wrong
dead wrong
wrong
i don't see it that way
i don't think so
oh so
no way
i disagree
are you sure
any sense
no sense
i'm afraid i disagree
i totally disagree
i beg to differ
i'd say the exact opposite
i wouldn't
not necessarily
not at all
false
not true
don't say that
that's not always true
that's not always the case
i'm not so sure about that
nope
that's different
i don't agree with you
however
that's not entirely true
on the contrary
i'm sorry to disagree with you but
yes but don't you think
that's not the same thing at all
i'm afraid i have to disagree
i'm not so sure about that 
i must take issue with you on that
it's unjustifiable to say that
i'm not sure about that
you could be right but
i'm afraid i don't agree
i agree up to a point but
that's an interesting idea but
do you really think
so you think
rubbish
bullshit
nonsense
you can't be serious
actually
as a matter of fact
i think
don't make sense
doesn't make sense
that's not how i see it
no it's not
there is a difference
who do you think you are
that's not
this is not
don't try
don't even try
////
im my honest opinion
in my opinion
the way i see it
if you want my honest opinion
according to
as far as i'm concerned
if you ask me
i think
i suggest
i believe
