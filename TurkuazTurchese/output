America was founded by white-supremacists, like Ayn Rand who didn't understand why Native Americans hated being conquered!!! @Carter137 @GOP

.@Adamizer1  You're an idiot. Ayn Rand was a Russian Jew. Also, Native Americans were killing and torturing each other long before whites.

Marxist Alert---&gt;@Adamizer1  believes  that Marx was a "REAL economist".  I'll bet he doesn't know that Che Guevara was a mass-murdering PIG

As for Che...do you call your hero George Washington "mass murderer" as well for the people he killed??? Just wondering. #Dumbass @Carter137

.@Adamizer1 Assume much?  I never said my hero was George Washington.  It's clearly documented that my favorite founding father is Franklin.

@SMFIII LOL.  However, @Adamizer1 is good at licking something.  Earlier in his tweets, he said he was getting "tea-bagged" by US!
